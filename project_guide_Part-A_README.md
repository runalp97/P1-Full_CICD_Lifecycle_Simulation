**Full CI/CD Lifecycle Simulation — DevOps Project**

This project simulates a real-world, week-long DevOps workflow involving planning, collaboration, CI/CD pipeline creation, infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, containerization, and deployment.
It mirrors the daily activities of a DevOps engineer using tools like Jira, Slack, Git, Jenkins, Docker, Terraform, Ansible, and AWS.

**Overview:**
This project demonstrates an end-to-end CI/CD process used in modern DevOps teams:


⚪ Planning work and tracking progress using Jira


⚪ Team communication via Slack


⚪Version control & CI pipeline using Git + Jenkins


⚪Containerization using Docker


⚪Infrastructure provisioning using Terraform (AWS EC2, VPC, S3)


⚪ Configuration management using Ansible


⚪ Deployment of the app to AWS


⚪ Updating Jira and communicating deployment status via Slack



This is a complete DevOps lifecycle simulation from planning → coding → building → deploying → documentation.

⚪ Containerized and deployed application on AWS



 🧪 How to Run: 
 
⚪**This is the part A of the project where i did tasks (1 - 4), remaining task (5) is in the part B of this project **

1️⃣ Start the Project

•	Open Jira and review the assigned task.

•	Understand the requirements, acceptance criteria, and timeline.

•	Join the project Slack channel and align with your team.
________________________________________
2️⃣ Set Up CI/CD Pipeline

•	Create a Jenkins pipeline job.

•	Connect Jenkins with the GitHub repository.

•	Add a Jenkinsfile containing build, test, package, and deployment stages.

•	Make sure each code push triggers the pipeline automatically.

________________________________________
3️⃣ Prepare Application & Code Repository

•	Build the sample application and containerize it using a Dockerfile.

•	Upload application code, Dockerfile, Jenkinsfile, Terraform files, and Ansible playbooks to GitHub.

•	Maintain meaningful commit messages and a clean folder structure.

________________________________________
4️⃣ Provision Cloud Infrastructure

•	Use Terraform to automatically create the required AWS resources such as:

o	EC2 Instance
o	VPC
o	Security Groups
o	Networking Components

•	After provisioning, collect the EC2 public IP to confirm infrastructure is ready.

________________________________________
5️⃣ Configure Servers

•	Use Ansible to automate server setup:

o	Install necessary packages (Docker, Nginx, runtime dependencies).
o	Prepare the environment for deployment.

•	Ensure the instance is reachable and ready for the application.
